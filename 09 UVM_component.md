## Features
* Hierarchy : hierarchial structure, forming tree like structure and providing methods for searching and traversing the tree
* Phasing : Components can participate in UVM phasing mechanism, which organizes simulation into different phases like build, connect, run,and cleanup
* Reporting : Components use UVM messaging infrastructure to report events, warnings, errors
* Factory : Components can be registered with factory, enabling dynamic object creation and lookup

* Phase allows components to construct their internal hierarchy, connect to other components,and finalize their configurations before the actual test starts.
